# MyReads project

## Project description

This is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application. An API server and client library was provided by Udacity, which is used to persist information

In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there. There is a checkmark showing the current shelf.

The main page also has a link to /search, a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library. MyReads Search page can be accessed from localhost:3000/search URL. When a book searched is already on a bookshelf, it has the same state on both the main application page and the search page.

The search page also has a link to / (the root URL), which leads back to the main page.

When you navigate back to the main page from the search page, you instantly see all of the selections you made on the search page in your library.

## Quick start

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

### Backend Server

A backend server [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods to perform necessary operations on the backend:

- [`getAll`](#getall)
- [`update`](#update)
- [`search`](#search)

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
